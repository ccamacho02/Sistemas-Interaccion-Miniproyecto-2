## Project Description
"Enchanted Forest Adventure Game" is a text-based adventure game where the player embarks on a journey through a mysterious enchanted forest. The goal is to find and collect three sacred objects while solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and interacting with various characters. Each decision the player makes influences the outcome of the story, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.

The game combines elements of classic adventure games like Zork with modern storytelling, offering a unique blend of exploration, strategy, and narrative.

## Game Overview
In the game, the player starts at the edge of the enchanted forest and must navigate through various locations, such as the Dark Cave, Black Lake, and Stone Altar. Along the way, they will encounter different characters, solve riddles, and face enemies. The ultimate objective is to collect the three sacred objects: the Crystal Fragment, the Golden Feather, and the Silver Bell. These objects are required to escape the forest and complete the game.

Throughout the journey, the player can:
- Move between different rooms using commands such as "north," "south," "east," and "west."
- Interact with objects found in different locations.
- Solve puzzles to  obtain objects.
- Engage in battles with enemies or choose to flee.
- Use objects from their inventory to aid in their progress.
